# Summary
This mod adds several new combat encounters from OSRS and RS3 to the world of [Melvor Idle](https://www.melvoridle.com/). Of course, this comes with a multitude of new armour and weapons, including a lot of new equipment.

Feel free to contribute directly or tell us your ideas, be it improvements (e.g. balancing) to existing content, or completely new content. ([Create an issue](https://github.com/KumaV1/Runescape-Encounters-in-Melvor/issues) or contact me on discord `@___kuma___`)

# Prefice
* I will not add any content known to be in other mods (e.g. GWD1 or ToB), maybe migrate them, if the original creators support doing so, but not for now
* The content of the mod is likely still unbalanced. Please feel free to let me know about any issues or suggestions
* As always, if you want to be save, create a save file first (although the mod currently only consists of assets and data, so it shouldn't brick your game)


# Content
* While the summary mentions OSRS, there is currently no OSRS specific content in this mod (though there is Dagannoth Kings at least)
* Currently all added as Combat areas

## Dagannoth Kings
* Meant to be somewhat low-level encounters
* Rewards T30 rings

## Rex Matriarchs
* Meant to be somewhat mid-level encounters
* Rewards T60 rings (Ugrades to T30 rings) and a T70 melee 2h weapon with poison effect and lifesteal on poison

## God Wars Dungeon 2 - Heart of Gielinor
* Meant to be around the same level as God Dungeons
* Rewards T80 armour and weapons for all combat styles
  * Armour has slightly higher offense than God Dungeon armour, in exchange for no Damage reduction
  * Weapons currently have around same offense bonus as other Weapons of the same tier, but with a 15% accuracy boost on top of it

# Ideas (no promises)

## Mod Settings (if implementable / feasible UX wise)
* Toggling visibility of each combat area/slayer area/dungeon, to avoid cluttering the UI, if the mod happens to become bigger (alternatively/in addition, some UI customization to add new section?)
* Not a mod setting, but providing separate mods that are identical in all but the images used, 
  so with content that exists in both games, images would primarily use either OSRS or RS3 graphic (maybe even ~2011 era)
  * Idea of doing this is to avoid bloating a mod with a bunch of unused images
  * By having identical namespace, they should be interchangeable (just don't use them at the same time)
* Other ideas?

## Content
### Balancing across the board
* Some monsters or items are likely too overpowered or underperforming for where they are supposed to be
* Possibly add fremennik armour to Dagannoth Kings, as another way of obtaining some early-level armour

### Possibly making some implementations more faithful to how they work in (Old School) Runescape
* One example would be Gregorovic currently having a passive to represent his ghost spawn special, rather than a special (per ghost) that continues to stack the corresponding modifiers everytime the respective special is used (possibly limited at 2)

### Localization and text in general
* Improve descriptions across the board (e.g. standardize from what viewpoint specials and passives are described, or specifying when a special uses a different attack style than the normal attack)
* Can personally only provide English and German translations
* Updates would initially only consist of those languages, other languages having to be added by someone else (unless machine translation is used)

### More content
#### Encounters having the chance to drop ancient effigies
* Would give X (scaling?) experience total across X (non-combat) skills at random (doesn't seem worth it though, considering things like "Man I hate agility" isn't an issue in an idle game; though I guess being able to train a skill through combat (and not requiring to get resources) may have some sort of niche?)
* Similar to signet ring half (with chance based on combat level for example, could even add modifiers as rewards somewhere)
* Mod setting to toggle being able to get effigies between the options from "All monsters", "Only monsters added by this mod" and "No monsters at all"

#### Queen Black dragon (Combat Area or Dungeon)
* Drops dragon visage, combinable with shield slot items of the different combat styles (<=t70) to create a dragon fire shield for **every** style, [rather than having only a melee one](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/w/Dragonfire_Shield)
* Royal crossbow
  * Based on its functionality pre-EOC, idea being it gets a lot of attack accurary, power and/or interval over the course of a longer fight

#### Void Knight's Outpost (Dungeon)
* Providing void armour (Mid-level armour, really high offense but shit defence)

#### Glacors and Automatons (Slayer Area(s))
* High level boots and gloves (God dungeon equivalents-ish)
 
#### Telos (Dungeon)
* I feel like just slapping some generic passives / special attacks on him isn't really doing him justice
* That said, there are mechanics, that do not yet seem to exist in Melvor and might be hard (or at least a lot of effort) to implement
  * E.g. "On stun, re-roll what attack to do, if current next attack is a certain special attack"
  * E.g. "On next attack selection, if attack is certain special, greatly lower attack interval, to simulate charging up (and allow for cancellation)"
  * E.g. "On monster death/spawn, remove/add x stacks of a debuff on player" (I think there are already some debuffs and corresponding modifiers like that)

#### GWD3 (Dungeons)
* Supposed to be very high level
* Bosses would drop T3 troves
  * Among other things, would probably include TotH items, if you have the expansion (only early ones, though, if the bosses are supposed to be defeatable without any TotH improvements)
    * Could alternatively implement normal mode (Melvor full) and hard mode (TotH)? In that case, T2 troves would have Normal mode special drops, while T3 troves would also have the hardmode specific drops; also requiring x normal mode kills to unlock
* Using resonant anima to buy T1 troves from shop, for additional resources
  * Shop purchase to be able to gain Resonant anima of Bik through skilling
  * Shop purchase to be able to buy higher tier Bik trove, also including skilling offhands (combined with above purchase, would make skilling offhands obtainable without combat)
* Scriptures / Manuscripts as Consumables
* Weapons being (among) the strongest, at least purely offensively
* If an idea comes to mind, then a Tzhaar combat area and Tzekhaar front would drop Tokkul to spend on something
* One time shop purchase per front that buffs a skilling activity (or alternatively some combat stats/effects), akin to the elemental dungeon purchases
  * Idea for combat stats/effects would be "X% increased change to stun/frostbite/poison/burn"
* Others ideas?
