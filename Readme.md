# Summary
This mod adds several new combat encounters from both OSRS and RS3 to the world of [Melvor Idle](https://www.melvoridle.com/). Of course, this comes with a multitude of new armour and weapons, including a lot of new equipment.

Feel free to contribute directly or tell us your ideas, be it improvements (e.g. balancing) to existing content, or completely new content. 

# Prefice
* I will not add GWD1 for now, [as a mod for that already exists](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/godwars-recreation).

# Content
**Note: While the summary mentions OSRS, there is currently no OSRS specific content in this mod.** (though there is Dagannoth Kings at least)

## Dagannoth Kings
* Meant to be somewhat low-level encounters
* Rewards T30 rings

## Rex Matriarchs
* Meant to be somewhat mid-level encounters
* Rewards T60 rings (Ugrades to T30 rings) and a T60 (or T70?) melee 2h weapon with poison effect and lifesteal on poison

## God Wars Dungeon 2 - Heart of Gielinor
* Meant to be around the same level as God Dungeons
* Rewards T80 armour and weapons for all combat styles
  * Armour has slightly higher offense than God Dungeon armour, in exchange for no Damage reduction
  * Weapons currently have around same offense bonus as other Weapons of same tier, but with a 15% accuracy boost on top of it

# Ideas (no promises)

## Mod Settings (if implementable)
* Toggling visibility of each combat area/slayer area/dungeon, to avoid cluttering the UI, if the mod happens to become bigger (alternatively/in addition, some UI customization to add new section?)
* Not a mod setting, but providing separate mods that are identical in all but the images used, 
  so with content that exists in both games, images would primarily use either OSRS or RS3 graphic (maybe even ~2011 era)
  * Idea of doing this is to avoid bloating a mod with a bunch of unused images
  * By having identical namespace, they should be interchangeable (just don't use them at the same time)
* Other ideas?

## Content
* Improve images used, as some are very small, making them very blurry in certain menus
* Improve balancing across the board
* Possibly making some implementations more faithful to how they work in (Old School) Runescape
  * One example would be Gregorovic currently having a passive to represent his ghost spawn special, rather than a special (per ghost) that continues to stack the corresponding modifiers everytime the respective special is used (possibly limited at 2)
* Improve descriptions across the board (e.g. standardize from what viewpoint specials and passives are described, or specifying when a special uses a different attack style than the normal attack)
* Enabling localization
  * Can personally only provide English and German translations
  * Updates would initially only consist of those languages, other languages having to be added by someone else (unless machine translation is used)
* More content / encounters
  * Encounters having the chance to drop ancient effigies, which would give X (scaling?) experience total across X (non-combat) skills at random (doesn't seem worth it though, considering things like "Man I hate agility" isn't an issue in an idle game; though I guess being able to train a skill through combat (and not requiring to get resources) may have some sort of niche?)
    * Either for only mod mobs, or alternatively could also be added globally similar to signet ring half (with chance based on combat level for example, could even add modifiers as rewards somewhere)
    * Mod setting to disable getting effigies
  * Possibly add fremennik armour to Dagannoth Kings, as an alternative to some early-level armour that could be obtained without skilling
  * "Void Knight's Outpost" dungeon, providing void armour (Mid-level armour, really high offense but shit defence)
  * Glacors and Automatons for higher level boots and gloves
  * Telos
    * I feel like just slapping some generic passives / special attacks on him isn't really doing him justice
    * That said, there are mechanics, that do not yet seem to exist in Melvor and might be hard (or at least a lot of effort) to implement
      * E.g. "On stun, re-roll what attack to do, if current next attack is a certain special attack"
      * E.g. "On next attack selection, if attack is certain special, greatly lower attack interval, to simulate charging up (and allow for cancellation)"
      * E.g. "On monster death/spawn, remove/add x stacks of a debuff on player" (I think there are already some debuffs and corresponding modifiers like that)
  * GWD3 (very high level)
    * Bosses would drop T3 troves
      * Among other things, would probably include TotH items, if you have the expansion (only early ones, though, if the bosses are supposed to be defeatable without any TotH improvements)
        * Could alternatively implement normal mode (Melvor full) and hard mode (TotH)? In that case, T2 troves would have Normal mode special drops, while T3 troves would also have the hardmode specific drops; also requiring x normal mode kills to unlock
    * Using resonant anima to buy T1 troves from shop, for additional resources
      * Shop purchase to be able to gain Resonant anima of Bik through skilling
      * Shop purchase to be able to buy higher tier Bik trove, also including skilling offhands (combined with above purchase, would make skilling offhands obtainable without combat)
    * Scriptures / Manuscripts as Consumables
    * Weapons being (among) the strongest, at least purely offensively
    * If an idea comes to mind, then a Tzhaar combat area and Tzekhaar front would drop Tokkul to spend on something
    * One time shop purchase per front that buffs a skilling activity (or alternatively some combat stats/effects), akin to the elemental dungeon purchases
      * Idea for combat stats/effects would be "X% increased change to stun/frostbite/poison/burn"
  * Others ideas?
