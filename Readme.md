# Summary
This mod adds several new combat encounters from OSRS and RS3 to the world of [Melvor Idle](https://www.melvoridle.com/). 
Of course, this comes with a multitude of new armour and weapons.

Feel free to contribute directly or tell us your ideas, be it improvements (e.g. balancing) to existing content, or completely new content. ([Create an issue](https://github.com/KumaV1/Runescape-Encounters-in-Melvor/issues) or contact me on discord `@___kuma___`)

# Prefice
* I will not add any content known to be in other mods (e.g. GWD1 or ToB), maybe migrate them, if the original creators support doing so, but not for now
* The content of the mod is likely still unbalanced. Please feel free to let me know about any issues or suggestions
* As always, if you want to be save, create a save file first (although the mod currently only consists of assets and data, so it shouldn't brick your game)

# Content
* While the summary mentions OSRS, there is currently no OSRS specific content in this mod (though there is Dagannoth Kings at least)

## Global droptable
* Several items separately rolled for by all or a certain group of monsters

## Dagannoth Kings
* Combat Area
* Meant to be somewhat low-level encounters
* Rewards T30 rings
* All monsters are a boss and have a pet drop

## Rex Matriarchs
* Combat Area
* Meant to be somewhat mid-level encounters
* Rewards T60 rings (Ugrades to T30 rings) and a T70 melee 2h weapon with poison effect and lifesteal on poison
* All monsters are a boss and have a pet drop

## God Wars Dungeon 2 - Heart of Gielinor
* Meant to be around the same level as God Dungeons
* Rewards T80 armour (helmet, body, legs) and weapons for all combat styles
  * Armour has slightly higher offense than God Dungeon armour, in exchange for no Damage reduction
  * Weapons currently have around same offense bonus as other Weapons of the same tier, but with a 15% accuracy boost on top of it
* All monsters are a boss and have a pet drop

## Glacor Cave
* Meant be not quite GWD2 level, but also not too weak
* Rewards
  * T80 boots
    * Slightly higher offense than God Dungeon armour, in exchange for no Damage reduction
  * T77 staff, that also enables a new standard and a new aurora spell

# Ideas (no promises)

## Mod Settings (if implementable / feasible UX wise)
* Toggling visibility of each combat area/slayer area/dungeon, to avoid cluttering the UI, if the mod happens to become bigger (alternatively/in addition, some UI customization to add new section?)
* Not a mod setting, but providing separate mods that are identical in all but the images used, 
  so with content that exists in both games, images would primarily use either OSRS or RS3 graphic (maybe even ~2011 era)
  * Idea of doing this is to avoid bloating a mod with a bunch of unused images
  * By having identical namespace, they should be interchangeable (just don't use them at the same time)
* Other ideas?

## Content
### More content
Please check the [Issues](https://github.com/KumaV1/Runescape-Encounters-in-Melvor/issues) page

### Balancing across the board
* Some monsters or items are likely too overpowered or underperforming for where they are supposed to be
* Possibly add fremennik armour to Dagannoth Kings, as another way of obtaining some early-level armour

### Possibly making some implementations more faithful to how they work in (Old School) Runescape
* One example would be Gregorovic currently having a passive to represent his ghost spawn special, rather than a special (per ghost) that continues to stack the corresponding modifiers everytime the respective special is used (possibly limited at 2)

### Localization and text in general
* Improve descriptions across the board (e.g. standardize from what viewpoint specials and passives are described, or specifying when a special uses a different attack style than the normal attack)
* Can personally only provide English and German translations
* Updates would initially only consist of those languages, other languages having to be added by someone else (unless machine translation is used)
