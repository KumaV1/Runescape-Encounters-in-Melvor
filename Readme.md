# Summary
This mod adds several new combat encounters from both OSRS and RS3 to the world of Melvor Idle. Of course, this comes with a multitude of new drops, including a lot of new equipment.

# Of note
I will purpose not add GWD1 for now, as a mod for that already exists

# Mod Settings ideas (if implementable)
* Allow toggling between image paths of assets, if they exist in both OSRS and RS3, so you can choose wichever you prefer
  * There will still be probably only one implementation respectively, with rewards based on one version (e.g. Nex would likely have the OSRS rewards, rather than RS3 and other GWD1 bosses wouldn't have items that were later added in RS3)
* Maybe be able to toggle whether you can see RS3/OSRS content? As there might be some people that just really don't want to deal with one version of the game...
